# ContainerProtect
ContainerProtect is a minecraft plugin that adds protections on your chest. Similar to LWC, but a lot more lightweight and doesn't uses blocking thread queries. Instead of using SQL (or any other type of database) it uses Spigot's 1.14 PersistentDataHolder API to store data directly on the containers.
