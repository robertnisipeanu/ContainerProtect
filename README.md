# ContainerProtect
ContainerProtect is a minecraft(spigot) plugin that adds protections on your chests.

ContainerProtect is similar to LWC, but it is a lot more lightweight and doesn't uses queries that blocks the main thread. Instead of using SQL (or any other type of database) it uses Spigot's 1.14 PersistentDataHolder API to store data directly on the containers (chests/furnaces/hoppers and any other block of which it's BlockState extends the [TileState](https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/block/TileState.html) class). Unlike LWC, this results in "queries" that aren't noticeable at all (or mostly at all) as the server will load the data with the block (and that usually happens when the chunk loads), loading the data just as it would load the items stored inside the chest.
